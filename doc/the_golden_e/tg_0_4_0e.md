## General syntax

Any letter or whitespace is a comment.

```tg
this is a comment
```

Comments can be also marked by surrounding them with `"`

```tg
"this is a comment, which contains other characters as well, like comma, semicolon: ;, colon: :, dot..."
```

Functions are defined by a pair of equal natural numbers (including zero).

```tg
0
	this is function "0"
0
4
	this is function "4"
4
5
	this is a part function "5"
42
	"this is code common for functions 5 and 42"
5
	"this is a part function 42"
42
```

If the code contains function 79 (proton number of gold), then it's called on program startup.

You can specify flags in the code by using `#flag#` or `#flag<newline>`, like this:
```
#someFlag
#someFlagWithParam paramValue#
#someFlag#4
	function "4"
4
```

TG 0.4.0E supports only one flag - `#version <version>`, which specifies the language version. When using TG 0.4.0E, it should be `#version 0.4.0E`.

## Memory layout

In TG, the memory is made of vectors of doubles. They are named _memory rows_ and their items _cells_. Each memory row has it's own pointer, and you can read from or write to the cell the pointer points to. The pointer starts at cell 0. If we do instructions like this:

```
move pointer 3 to right
set 4
move pointer 2 to left
set 5
move pointer 1 to right
get "returns 4"

state is
0 0 5 4
      ^
```

Memory rows are avaliable in pairs, named _memory_. Each memory has one active and one inactive row. The only exception from the zero-initialization is the cell 0 of the inactive row in _each_ memory, which is set to 1 (for brainf*** compatibility, which 0.4.0E breaks again, but it still keeps it closer).

If you try to read or write to cell to the left of cell 0, the behavior is undefined and likely to break the whole program.

## Basic commands

TG command | description | brainf\*\*\* equivalent
--- | --- | ---
`!` | adds `1` to the value in the active row | `+`
`~` | substracts `1` from the value in the active row | `-`
`<` | shifts the pointer of the active row by 1 to the left | `<`
`>` | shifts the pointer of the active row by 1 to the right | `>`
`.` | prints the character with the id of floor of the value in the active row | `.`
`,` | sets the value in the actove row to id of the character | `,`
`[]` | makes a while loop (of the code inside the brackets) with condition `value in the active row != 0` | `[]`

Character ID should be compatible with ASCII, but since the IO is done through C's standard library and as far as I know C doesn't guarantee chars to be ASCII compatible, it's not guaranteed here as well. You can count on it being ASCII in your programs, since ASCII is generaly used.

### Arithmetic

Let's call the value in active row A and the value in inactive row B.

TG command | description
--- | ---
`+` | set A to A + B
`-` | set A to A - B
`*` | set A to A * B
`/` | set A to A / B
`_` | set A to floor(A)
`&` | set A to ceil(A)

The behavior of division by zero is undefined.
